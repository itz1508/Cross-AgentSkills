"""Planner-owned, read-only CodeDesign review guidance; never an admission gate.

Adapted from the deep-module ideas in mattpocock/skills:
https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/tree/main/skills/engineering/codebase-design

This is an advisory skill, not a second scanner, persisted stage contract, role,
repository inspector, or host dispatcher. Audit Discovery supplies source-grounded
CodeDesign candidates; Planning evaluates designs and records decisions in the
existing planning contracts. Runtime owns trusted checks, effects and receipts.
